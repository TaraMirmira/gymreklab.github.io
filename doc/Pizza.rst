Ordering Pizza for the Lab
==========================

Who should I buy pizza from?
----------------------------
I've been using Domino's. It can be hard for delivery drivers to find you on UCSD's campus, but Domino's has a dropdown menu with every building on campus! You can even enter the exact room number, but it's probably easier if you just tell them to deliver to the nearest street or parking lot. You should specify those details in the delivery notes.
If you order with Domino's, make sure to look for coupon codes on their website. There's usually one for 20% off.

How many pizzas should I buy?
-----------------------------
For a party of 15, I usually buy 5-6 large pizzas, but if you're purchasing for a lot more people, you might want to aim for extra large pizzas instead.
Domino's has information about how many pizzas to order `here <https://www.dominos.com/en/about-pizza/how-many-slices-are-in-a-large-pizza>`__, but it's always better to overestimate than to underestimate. I'm of the opinion that the estimates they give are always too little.
You'll get more "bang for your buck" if you buy extra large pizzas than large pizzas. But if you buy extra large pizzas, be aware of the fact that people will often eat more than if you bought large pizzas -- just because the slices are larger. Also, the extra large pizzas are usually "Brooklyn style" only, which means that the dough is really thin and the toppings usually slide off the pizza when you try to take a bite. For these reasons, I almost always stick to the large pizzas for most occassions and only order extra larges for larger events.

What kinds of pizza should I buy?
---------------------------------
I aim for ratios of 1:2:1 for vegetarian : chicken : pepperoni. So if I'm purchasing 4 pizzas, I get 1 vegetarian, 2 chicken, and 1 pepperoni. Sometimes I order 2 pepperoni and 1 chicken, but it's important that there be at least one chicken option in case there are a few people who don't eat red meat / pork. For the vegetarian pizza, I usually order "Pacific Veggie" under *Specialty Pizzas*.
If you know that you'll need to order the pizza ahead of time, you can send out a poll (in the #food channel on Slack) to see what people like. I recommend doing this at least a day before, in case they don't see it immediately. Sending out a poll can also help you get a list of names for later when you need to request reimbursement (see below).

Should I add a tip?
-------------------
Yes. Definitely. The drivers apparently don't get reimbursed for the price of gas, so inflation has been hard on them. But the nearest Domino's store is close, so I usually give them just $4-7 (or around 6-7% of the order total).

When should I have them deliver?
--------------------------------
At least 30 (preferably, 45) minutes before the event. You never know when something will go wrong, and you'll want to leave some time to call them and reorder the pizza if they somehow lost the order. (This hasn't happened to me with Domino's yet, just other providers.)
I submit my order at least 2.5 hrs ahead of the event time. For a really large party (of 40, for example), I would make it 3 or 4 hrs ahead of time. You might even want to call them to confirm they received it and can handle it, especially for such a large group.

If you have the ability to park on campus then it might be easier to just pick it up from them. I have never done this myself, though.

How should I pay?
-----------------
Do not use your own credit card! (Reimbursement requires Dorit to `register you on Concur <https://support.ucsd.edu/finance?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0031969&sys_kb_id=dbdb7b3e1b183810506f64e8624bcbd8>`__.) Ask Melissa for her credit card when you're ready to order. If you can't find her, ask Arya.

What should I do prior to the event?
------------------------------------
Watch for phone calls! They usually call 2-3 minutes before the delivery to confirm the delivery location.
If you don't answer your phone and/or they can't find you at the designated location (for FAH: the corner of Voigt Dr and Equality Ln), they will simply cancel the delivery. They are on a tight schedule and will have limited patience for you.
Be aware that they might deliver early or late. At most, I've seen them deliver 20 minutes early or 40 minutes late.
Also, call them ahead of time to see if they can deliver plates and knapkins. They usually don't have plates -- in which case, you can use some of the lab's paper plates. (Currently, these are stored in the top shelf of the drawer under Arya's desk.) You can ask Dorit to buy new paper plates (every couple months).

What should I do after the event?
---------------------------------
You can return plates and knapkins to wherever you found them: either Arya's desk drawer or the kitchen. You can put any leftover pizza in the kitchen fridge. Message the #food channel of the `collaboratory Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/cpg-collaboratory>`_ to let them know that there's free pizza!

Note that FAH facilities has asked that we refrain from overloading the trash bins at FAH with pizza boxes. Instead, you can dump the trash into one of the black wagons in the FAH loading dock. You can access the loading dock via the basement level of FAH. Go to the end of the hall and turn left.

Reimbursement
-------------
Email Dorit with a PDF of your receipt as well as a list of each person who ate pizza and their titles (ex: "Graduate Student", "Professor", "Postdoc", etc). CC Melissa or whoever paid. In the body of your email, mention the total cost and explain who should be reimbursed.
